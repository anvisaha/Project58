      <p>My favourite hobby is reading. Whenever I get bored and have nothing to do I pick up a book and start reading. Most of the nights before going to bed I read a book. In school I learned that reading is a good habit and it helps increase your knowledge. Once I started reading it helped me with voice modulation. Reading helps me get inspiration to make my own stories. I like to read adventure books. One of my favourite books I have read so far is called "Magic Tree House". Before I didn't like reading as much but now it has become one of my favourite hobbies. Anybody can develope a habbit of reading if they give it a chance!</p>
